## Basic workflow
1. SplashRequest restaurant
2. SplashJsonResponse
   1. :html()
   2. clickable_menu_items :modal.outerHTML()
3. Spider
   1. Parse entire page: dish-list > .dish-card.h-product.menu__item
   2. if SplashJsonResponse has modal content for the item render that too

## Dish categories:
- simple => no options to select
- dish#1 => simple but with variations (all/most options are required and can't really be considered extras)
- dish#2 => something inbetween #1 and #3,definetly not a combo/oferta but has a larger degree of variation than #1 (paid extras maybe?)
- dish#3 => Combo/Oferta: most selection options are simple menu items that can be bough by themselves

## Might cause problems:
- 2 different address submit buttons, depending on view port
  - should be fine with splash view_port_full
- items with multiple variations
  - => dish card check variations.length 
- ConstanTZa => escaped chars
- chains (not restaurants)
- concurrent requests
- dish category description
- chains redirect to local restaurant

## TODO:
- [x] structure country/city crawl
  - [ ] add restaurant info:
    - info
    - delivery hours
    - adress
    - restaurant banner link
- [x] pass regex'd coords from splashReq directly to scrapy
- [x] remove trailing comma at the end (pipeline.py)
- [ ] Handle request errors


## Consider:
- async requests
- get list of vendors per city and parse list of x>city>vendor


## Variations and Toppings
if (variation_id):
    if (no topping_ids):
        DO NOTHING
    else:
        parse topping_selectors
elif (variation_ids):
    if ()
    parse variation_selector
    if (topping_ids diff):
        click all variations and store topping_selectors
    else:
        click 1st variation and parse topping_selectors

## Topping types:
- https://www.foodpanda.ro/restaurant/v4no/pizza-hut-delivery-brasov-nord#toppings
  - Pizza Super Suprema
    - 'topping selection-required'
    - 'topping topicOptionCheckbox'
- url
  - item
    - 'topping topicOptionCheckbox selection-required'


## Fix variation clicking
- [x] look for splash real time view
  - element:png
  - splash:evaljs("short js snippet") - no function wrapping needed
  - splash:har - check it out => useless
  - element:send_keys/send_text


## Left TODO:
- [x] Coords: get them easier with bs and splash from page object json
- [x] ' V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti' in scrapped text: check encoding
- [x] Add image debugging in splash by default
- [x] Models ON DELETE/UPDATE CASCADE

## DB insert:
- use original dish id? => Seems to be the best solution
- use vendor url as primary key?

## Finish:
- [x] check if address validated
- [ ] Crawl cities and check if vendor already scrapped, if update delete and re insert
- [ ] add name/price to variation
- [x] https://www.foodpanda.ro/chain/cj2cc/pizza-romana coords


## Timeouts:
- [x] Invalid coords, address hanging
- [x] Can't click modals


## Other:
- [ ] SAWarning: Object of type <Variation> not in session, add operation along 'Dish.variations' will not proceed % (orm_util.state_class_str(state), operation, prop)
- [ ] For now chains that can't verify address dont have var/toppings in db
