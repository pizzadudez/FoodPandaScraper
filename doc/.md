## Basic workflow
1. SplashRequest restaurant
2. SplashJsonResponse
   1. :html()
   2. clickable_menu_items :modal.outerHTML()
3. Spider
   1. Parse entire page: dish-list > .dish-card.h-product.menu__item
   2. if SplashJsonResponse has modal content for the item render that too

## Dish categories:
- simple => no options to select
- dish#1 => simple but with variations (all/most options are required and can't really be considered extras)
- dish#2 => something inbetween #1 and #3,definetly not a combo/oferta but has a larger degree of variation than #1 (paid extras maybe?)
- dish#3 => Combo/Oferta: most selection options are simple menu items that can be bough by themselves

## Might cause problems:
- 2 different address submit buttons, depending on view port
  - should be fine with splash view_port_full
- items with multiple variations
  - => dish card check variations.length 
- ConstanTZa
- chains (not restaurants)
- concurrent requests
- dish category description
- chains redirect to local restaurant

## TODO:
- [ ] structure country/city crawl
  - [ ] add restaurant info:
    - info
    - delivery hours
    - adress
    - restaurant banner link
- [ ] pass regex'd coords from splashReq directly to scrapy
- [ ] remove trailing comma at the end (pipeline.py)
- [ ] Handle request errors


## Consider:
- async requests
- get list of vendors per city and parse list of x>city>vendor


## Variations and Toppings
if (variation_id):
    if (no topping_ids):
        DO NOTHING
    else:
        parse topping_selectors
elif (variation_ids):
    if ()
    parse variation_selector
    if (topping_ids diff):
        click all variations and store topping_selectors
    else:
        click 1st variation and parse topping_selectors

## Topping types:
- https://www.foodpanda.ro/restaurant/v4no/pizza-hut-delivery-brasov-nord#toppings
  - Pizza Super Suprema
    - 'topping selection-required'
    - 'topping topicOptionCheckbox'
- url
  - item
    - 'topping topicOptionCheckbox selection-required'
