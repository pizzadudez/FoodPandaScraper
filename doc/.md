## Basic workflow
1. SplashRequest restaurant
2. SplashJsonResponse
   1. :html()
   2. clickable_menu_items :modal.outerHTML()
3. Spider
   1. Parse entire page: dish-list > .dish-card.h-product.menu__item
   2. if SplashJsonResponse has modal content for the item render that too

## Might cause problems:
- 2 different address submit buttons, depending on view port
  - should be fine with splash view_port_full
- items with multiple variations
  - => dish card check variations.length 

## TODO:
- [ ] structure country/city crawl
  - [ ] add restaurant info:
    - info
    - delivery hours
    - adress
    - restaurant banner link
- [ ] pass regex'd coords from splashReq directly to scrapy
- [ ] remove trailing comma at the end (pipeline.py)
